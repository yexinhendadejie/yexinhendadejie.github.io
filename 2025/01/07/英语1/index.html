Is it habits, connections,<br>luck, work ethic or any other behavior? I believe the key to success is willpower. Willpower is the ability to<br>control yourself. It is a strong determination that allows you to do something difficult. It is a behavior we are<br>born with more than one we learn; however, it is possible to not only learn it, but also strengthen it with<br>constant exercise.<br>‚Äã	Willpower is just like a muscle; to keep it strong you need to constantly exercise it. People with a great<br>amount of willpower have the discipline to develop positive, successful habits. Even with an incredible<br>amount of talent, without the discipline and motivation to create positive habits, it can be difficult to achieve<br>success.<br>‚Äã	Willpower and habits go hand in hand. It is critical to create good habits and take the actions necessary<br>to stick to those habits day in and day out for greater success. Almost half of our daily actions are part of our<br>habits and not decisions, so once the correct habits are in place, you will automatically perform those tasks on<br>a day-to-day basis.<br>‚Äã	The best way to create and stick to a habit is to have strong motivation. It‚Äôs easier to change your habits<br>to lose weight if you have a health issue and you want to be around longer for your kids, or if your business is<br>something you‚Äôre passionate about. Having a valuable outcome associated with a habit will help you stick to<br>that habit permanently.<br>‚Äã	The art of self-control is one that most successful individuals have mastered. Self-control enables you to<br>avoid behaviors that don‚Äôt contribute to your success and adopt those that do.<br>Because there is a delayed satisfaction associated with self-control, it can be easy to get off track.<br>However, if you work on sticking to those small positive habits one day at a time, it becomes easier to stay<br>strong and achieve that delayed reward. Once a reward is achieved, it is much easier to continue sticking to<br>your habits. </p>

<p>‚Äã	Today, most scientific research is funded by government grants, companies doing research and<br>development, and non-profit foundations. As a society, we reap the rewards from this science, but we also<br>help pay for it. You indirectly support science through taxes you pay, products and services you purchase, and<br>donations you make.<br>‚Äã	Funding for science has changed with the times. Historically, science has been largely supported through<br>private patronage (ËµÑÂä©), church sponsorship, or simply paying for the research yourself. Today, researchers<br>are likely to be funded by a mix of grants from various government agencies, institutions, and foundations.<br>Other research is funded by private companies. Such corporate sponsorship is widespread in some fields.<br>Almost 75% of U.S. clinical trials in medicine are paid for by private companies. And, of course, some<br>researchers today still fund small-scale studies out of their own pockets. Most of us can‚Äôt afford to do nuclear<br>research as a private hobby, but birdwatchers, rock collectors, and others can do real research on a limited<br>budget.<br>‚Äã	In a perfect world, money wouldn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî all scientific studies would be completely objective. But in<br>the real world, funding may introduce biases. Drug research sponsored by the pharmaceutical (Âà∂ËçØÁöÑ)<br>industry is more likely to end up favoring the drug under consideration than studies sponsored by government<br>grants or charitable organizations. Similarly, nutrition research sponsored by the food industry is more likely<br>to end up favoring the food under consideration than independently funded research.<br>‚Äã	So what should we make of all this? Should we ignore any research funded by companies or special<br>interest groups? Certainly not. These groups provide invaluable funding for scientific research. Furthermore,<br>science has many safeguards in place to catch instances of bias that affect research outcomes. Ultimately,<br>misleading results will be corrected as science proceeds; however, this process takes time. Meanwhile, it pays<br>to examine studies funded by industry or special interest groups with extra care. Are the results consistent<br>with other independently funded studies? What do other scientists have to say about this research? A little<br>examination can go a long way towards identifying bias associated with the funding source. </p>

Why do we allow what others think of us to have so much power over how we feel about<br>ourselves? If it‚Äôs true that you can‚Äôt please all people all of the time, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to stop trying?<br>Unfortunately, sense often isn‚Äôt driving our behavior. For social beings who desire love and belonging,<br>wanting to be liked, and caring about the effect we have on others, is healthy and allows us to make<br>connections. However, where we get into trouble is when our self-worth is dependent upon whether we win<br>someone‚Äôs approval or not.<br>This need to be liked can be traced back to when we were children and were completely dependent on<br>others to take care of us: Small children are not just learning how to walk and communicate, they are also<br>trying to learn how the world works. We learn about who we are and what is expected of us based on<br>interactions with others, so, to a four-year-old, if Mommy or Daddy doesn‚Äôt like him or her, there is the<br>danger that they will abandon them. We need to understand that when we desperately want someone to<br>approve of us, it‚Äôs being driven by that little kid part of us that is still terrified of abandonment.<br>As you become more capable of providing yourself with the approval you seek, your need for external<br>validation will start to vanish, leaving you stronger, more confident, and yes, happier in your life. Imagine<br>how much time we lose each moment we restrain our authentic selves in an effort to be liked.<br>If we base our worth on the opinions of others, we cheat ourselves of the power to shape our experiences<br>and embrace life not only for others but also for ourselves, because ultimately, there is no difference. So<br>embrace the clich√© (ËÄÅËØù) and love yourself as it‚Äôs highly doubtful that you‚Äôll regret it. </p>

<p>‚Äã	Some people have said aging is more a slide into forgetfulness than a journey towards wisdom. However,<br>a growing body of research suggests that late-in-life learning is possible. In reality, education does an aging<br>brain good.<br>‚Äã	Throughout life, people‚Äôs brains constantly renovate themselves. In the late 1960s, British brain scientist<br>Geoffrey Raisman spied growth in damaged brain regions of rats through an electron microscope; their brains<br>were forging new connections. This meant brains may change every time a person learns something new.<br>Of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean the brain isn‚Äôt affected by the effects of time. Just as height usually declines<br>over the years, so does brain volume: Humans lose about 4 percent every decade starting in their 40s. But that<br>reduction doesn‚Äôt necessarily make people think slower; as long as we are alive and functioning, we can alter<br>our brains with new information and experiences.<br>In fact, scientists now suspect accumulating novel experiences, facts, and skills can keep people‚Äôs minds<br>more flexible. New pathways can strengthen our ever-changing mental structure, even as the brain shrinks.<br>Conventional fixes like word puzzles and brain-training apps can contribute to mental durability. Even<br>something as simple as taking a different route to the grocery store or going somewhere new on vacation can<br>keep the brain healthy.<br>‚Äã	A desire for new life challenges can further boost brainpower. Research about aging adults who take on<br>new enterprises shows improved function and memory as well as a reduced risk of mental disease. Openness<br>‚Äî a characteristic defined by curiosity and a desire for knowledge ‚Äî may also help folks pass brain tests.<br>Some folks are born with this take-in-the-world attitude, but those who aren‚Äôt as genetically gifted aren‚Äôt<br>necessarily out of luck. While genes can encourage an interest in doing new things, a 2012 study in the<br>journal Psychology and Aging found completing reasoning tasks like puzzles and number games can enhance<br>that desire for novel experiences, which can, in turn, refresh the brain. That‚Äôs why brain scientist Richard<br>Kennedy says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that old dogs can‚Äôt learn new tricks. It‚Äôs that maybe old dogs don‚Äôt realize why they<br>should.‚Äù </p>

Sometimes it‚Äôs because I<br>actually am busy, but other times it‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what I think I‚Äôm supposed to say. That‚Äôs what important<br>people say. That‚Äôs what people who get promoted say. But working long hours doesn‚Äôt drive better results.<br>Never taking a vacation won‚Äôt lead to a promotion. So why are we so proud to talk about how busy we are all<br>the time?<br>‚Äã	In 2016, researchers from Columbia, Harvard, and Georgetown conducted a study to figure it out. They<br>found busy people are perceived to be of high status, and interestingly, these status attributions are heavily<br>influenced by our own beliefs about social mobility. In other words, the more we believe that one has the<br>opportunity for success based on hard work, the more we tend to think that people who skip leisure and work<br>all the time are of higher standing.<br>That‚Äôs why we feel like we have to appear busy, and there‚Äôs a real perception that if someone is kneeÔøædeep in meetings, emails and stress, then they‚Äôre probably a big deal. This culture of busyness is making it<br>hard for employees to find work-life balance. According to a recent study, one in five highly engaged<br>employees are at risk of burnout (Á≤æÁñ≤ÂäõÁ´≠).<br>Personally, I‚Äôm going to stop saying ‚Äúbusy‚Äù when people ask me how I am. It sounds self-righteous (Ëá™<br>‰ª•‰∏∫ÊòØÁöÑ) and sets the wrong tone. Phrases like ‚ÄúI have limited access to email‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll respond as soon as<br>I get back‚Äù sound like you‚Äôre being held against your will from working as opposed to making the most of<br>your time off.<br>‚Äã	That‚Äôs why we recently launched the Out of Office Email Generator, a free tool you can use before your<br>next long weekend or trip. You can share loud and proud that you won‚Äôt be checking email until you‚Äôre back.<br>Managers need to think twice about emailing their teams on the weekend and talking about how busy they are.<br>Leaders should take time off themselves and encourage employees to do the same. </p>

<p>‚Äã		Female employees consistently pay lower airfares than men do for the same flights because they tend to<br>book earlier.<br>‚Äã		We compared the airfare paid by employees in the same position within a company for the same class of<br>travel and used a common statistical technique to account for other factors that might affect differences in<br>airfares. We found that women paid on average 18 less per ticket than their male colleagues. Further<br>investigation allowed us to conclude that this gap is largely explained by the fact that women tended to book<br>earlier than men, 1.8 days on average.<br>We wanted to determine what was causing these gender differences in booking business trips so we<br>tested a variety of possible explanations, such as women choosing to plan ahead or male frequent travelers<br>being inclined to book late. None of these explained away the gender gap, so we applied data collected from<br>surveys that express consumer preferences that play a central role in economic decisions, such as patience and<br>risk avoidance.<br>We found that only the concept of ‚Äúnegative reciprocity‚Äù ‚Äî in which an employee who feels unfairly<br>treated engages in negative behaviors, such as spending their company‚Äôs money less carefully ‚Äî explains<br>these differences. The surveys showed men tend to exhibit more of these negative behaviors than women.<br>This isn‚Äôt to say that all men engage in these behaviors ‚Äî or that booking relatively late is a sign of abnormal<br>behavior. It only means that the gender gap disappears when we plug in the negative reciprocity variable.<br>Prior research on negative reciprocity among workers found that it can result in lower employee<br>motivation, business performance and workplace morale (Â£´Ê∞î) and culture.<br>‚Äã		Our results show another way these negative behaviors can manifest themselves, like in airline bookings,<br>and add to evidence that women are less likely to engage in them.<br>Companies spend significant sums of money on business travel. While that 18 difference per ticket may<br>seem small, it adds up. Our analysis suggests early booking by women can translate into savings of $1 million<br>a year for a large multinational company with 20,000 regular travelers. </p>

Despite this, popular culture and the<br>housing industry market happiness as living with both more space and more amenities (‰æøÂà©ËÆæÊñΩ). Big<br>houses are advertized as a reward for hard work and diligence, turning housing from a basic necessity<br>into a luxury.<br>‚Äã		This is reflected in our homes. The average single-family home built in the United States before<br>1970 was less than 1,500 square feet in size. By 2016, the average size of a new, single-family home was<br>2,422 square feet. What‚Äôs more, homes built in the 2000s were more likely than earlier models to have<br>more of all types of spaces: bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, dining rooms, recreation rooms and<br>garages.<br>‚Äã		There are consequences of living big. As middle-class houses have grown larger, two things have<br>happened. First, large houses take time to maintain, so cleaners and other low-wage service workers are<br>required to keep these houses in order. Second, once-public spaces, where people from diverse<br>backgrounds used to come together, have increasingly become privatized, leading to a reduction in the<br>number of public facilities available to all, and a reduced quality of life for many. Take swimming pools.<br>While in 1950, only 2,500 U.S. families owned pools, by 1999 this number was 4 million. At the same<br>time, public municipal pools were often closed, leaving low-income people nowhere to swim.<br>The trend for bigger housing thus poses ethical questions. Should Americans accept a system in<br>which the middle and upper classes enjoy a luxurious lifestyle, using the low-wage labor of others? Are<br>we willing to accept a system in which an increase in amenities purchased by the affluent means a<br>reduction in amenities for the poor?<br>‚Äã		I believe neither is acceptable. We must change the way we think: living well does not need to mean<br>having more private spaces; instead, it could mean having more public spaces. A better goal than building<br>bigger houses for some is to create more publicly accessible spaces and amenities for all. </p>

<p>‚Äã		Most of us in the entrepreneurial community are blessed ‚Äî or cursed ‚Äî with higher-than-average<br>ambition. Ambitious people strongly desire accomplishments and are willing to take more risks and<br>spend more effort to get them.<br>Overall, this is a positive quality, especially for people trying to build their own businesses.<br>Apparently, if you‚Äôre more naturally driven to set goals, you are more likely to succeed.<br>Actually, this isn‚Äôt always the case. In fact, in some cases, extreme ambition may end up doing more<br>harm than good.<br>‚Äã		One major side effect of excessive ambition is the tendency to focus too determinedly on one<br>particular vision or end goal. This is problematic because it hinders your ability to adapt to new<br>circumstances, which is vital if you want to be a successful entrepreneur. If a new competitor emerges to<br>threaten your business, you may need to change direction, even if that means straying from your original<br>vision. If you have too much ambition, you‚Äôll find this hard, if not impossible.<br>Few people are successful when they try to build their first brand. Unfortunately, for the most<br>ambitious entrepreneurs, a failure is seen as disastrous, and impossible to recover from.<br>It‚Äôs a clear departure from the intended plan toward the intended goal. For people with limited<br>ambition, however, failure is viewed as something closer to reality. Remember, failure is inevitable, and<br>every failure you survive is a learning experience.<br>Ambitious people tend to be more materialistically successful than their non-ambitious counterparts.<br>However, they‚Äôre only slightly happier than their less-ambitious counterparts, and tend to live<br>significantly shorter lives.

Without any ambition, you wouldn‚Äôt<br>start your own business, set or achieve goals and get far in life.

They all seem to stick to the ethos (ÁâπË¥®) of regional, seasonal produce.<br>For example, a traditional Mediterranean diet includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and<br>olive oil as the main components of nutritional intake. Fish, chicken and red wine make moderate<br>appearances, while red meat, salt and sugar are used much less often.

But Pasternak did take note of one<br>unifying factor in all of the healthy societies he observed. ‚ÄúThe only overlapping feature in most of these<br>healthy countries is that they all walk way more than the average American,‚Äù said Pasternak. ‚ÄúSo really,<br>regardless of what you‚Äôre eating, if someone‚Äôs walking four miles more than you each day, they‚Äôre going<br>to be a lot thinner and live a lot longer than you.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚Äã		Recognizing when a friend or colleague feels sad, angry or surprised is key to getting along with<br>others. But a new study suggests that being sensitive to people‚Äôs feelings may sometimes come with an<br>extra dose of stress. This and other research challenge the prevailing view that emotional intelligence is<br>uniformly beneficial to its bearer.<br>‚Äã		In a study, psychologist Myriam Bechtoldt of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management in<br>Germany asked 166 male university students a series of questions to measure their emotional intelligence.<br>For example, they showed the students photographs of people‚Äôs faces and asked them to what extent<br>feelings such as happiness or disgust were being expressed. The students then had to give job talks in<br>front of judges who displayed serious facial expressions. The scientists measured concentrations of stress<br>hormones in the students‚Äô saliva (ÂîæÊ∂≤) before and after the talk.<br>‚Äã		In students who were rated more emotionally intelligent, the stress measures increased more during<br>the experiment and took longer to go back to baseline. The findings suggest that some people may be too<br>emotionally clever for their own good, says Bechtoldt. ‚ÄúSometimes you can be so good at something that<br>it causes trouble,‚Äù she notes.<br>‚Äã		Indeed, the study adds to previous research hinting at a dark side of emotional intelligence. A study<br>published in 2002 in Personality and Individual Differences suggested that emotionally perceptive people<br>might be particularly influenced by feelings of depression and hopelessness. Furthermore, several studies<br>have implied that emotional intelligence can be used to manipulate others for personal gains.<br>More research is needed to see how exactly the relation between emotional intelligence and stress<br>would play out in women and in people of different ages and education levels. Nevertheless, emotional<br>intelligence is a useful skill to have, as long as you learn to also properly cope with emotions‚Äîboth<br>others‚Äô and your own, says Bechtoldt. For example, some sensitive individuals may assume responsibility<br>for other people‚Äôs sadness or anger, which ultimately stresses them out. Remember, as Bechtoldt says,<br>‚Äúyou are not responsible for how other people feel.‚Äù </p>
<ol start="51">
<li>What is the finding of the new study?<br>A) Emotional intelligence helps people get along with others.<br>B) Emotional intelligence is generally beneficial to its bearer.<br>C) People who are aware of others‚Äô feelings may experience more stress.<br>D) People who are emotionally stressed may have trouble making friends. </li>
<li>What was the purpose of psychologist Myriam Bechtoldt‚Äôs experiment?<br>A) To define different types of human feelings.<br>B) To assess the impacts of being emotionally clever.<br>C) To demonstrate how to distinguish different feelings.<br>D) To identify gender differences in emotional intelligence. </li>
<li>What does the finding of Myriam Bechtoldt‚Äôs study indicate?<br>A) Greater emotional cleverness means less trouble in one‚Äôs life.<br>B) Emotional intelligence helps people succeed in job interviews.<br>C) People‚Äôs psychological wellbeing is related to various factors.<br>D) People may suffer from having a high emotional intelligence. </li>
<li>What do we learn about emotional intelligence from a number of studies?<br>A) People suffering from depression are emotionally immature.<br>B) People who look at the dark side of life often feel depressed.<br>C) Some people may take advantage of it and benefit themselves<br>D) Some people may lack it and are easily manipulated by others. </li>
